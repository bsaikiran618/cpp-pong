 	Hi There!

	This project is a close clone of the popular game 'Pong' ,originally created by Alan Alcorn and
	released in 1972.
	The game is written entirely in c++ using the popular Simple DirectMedia Layer2(SDL2) library.
	No game engines were used in the making of this game.
	The motivation for this game was to explore game development from scratch.
	
	DISCLAIMER: The game is not perfect! There are glitches and bugs. Feel free to explore the source
	and possibly try to fix the bugs.

 This game works only on Linux right now. If I find more free time, Ill try to port it to windows as well.

HOW TO PLAY:
============

	The game is a two-player game. Player 1 controls the left paddle and Player 2 controls the right paddle.
	The ball must be hit by a player with the paddle and should be prevented from hitting the adjacent wall.
	
	The ball can be controlled in the folowing ways:
		Hitting it with the lower end of the paddle will deflect it towards the floor.
		Hitting it with the upper end of the paddle will deflect it towards the ceiling.
		Hitting it right with the center of the paddle will make it travel parallel to the floor.
	
	If the ball hits the right wall, Player 1 gets 1 point. If the ball hits the left wall, Player 2 get a 
	point. The player to score 5 points first wins the game.

Cheers! Enjoy! ;)
